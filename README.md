# rstory

This repo contains code related to the Rstory token on the EOS and ETH blockchains. rstory-site.html is in use on the [Rstory website](https://rstory.io). The site connects either to Anchor wallet + EOS blockchain or MetaMask wallet + ETH blockchain to determine if the user has an Rstory token. It the user has a token, links to digital products stored on IPFS are constructed and made available. To publish with Rstory, follow [these instructions](https://hive.blog/crypto/@rstory/getting-started-with-rstory) using the code in this repo.
