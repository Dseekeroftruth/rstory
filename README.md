This repo contains code related to the Rstory token on the EOS and ETH blockchains. rstory-site.html is in use on the [Rstory website](https://rstory.io). The site connects to Anchor wallet and the EOS blockchain to determine if the user has an Rstory token. It the user has a token, links to digital products stored on IPFS are constructed and made available.
