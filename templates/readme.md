## Rstory Page Templates

This folder is for html templates that make it easy to integrate Rstory into your site. Gateway templates shold be named xxxxGATE.html, where xxxx is the name of your template. Digital product templates should be named xxxxPRODUCT.html. All templates in this folder should be client side only, such that they can function serverless on IPFS. Please avoid inline styling and place your CSS in a style tag at the top of the file. Please avoid unnecessary dependencies i.e. use vanilla Javascript instead of jquery and custom CSS instead of Bootstrap etc.

## Contribute

To submit your templates for review, fork the rep and create a pull request. Include your EOS account address in the pull request in the format EOS address = "account address". If the submitted template looks good, it will be pulled into this folder and some Rstory tokens will be sent to the adddress provided.
